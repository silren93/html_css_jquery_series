    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Make That Wine!</h2>
    <p style="margin: 0px; text-align: justify;">Wine is the product of the fermentation of grape juice, in which yeast (a fungus) consumes the natural
            sugars within, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide as waste. Yeast grows naturally on many varieties
            of grapes, often visible as a white powder, and causing fermentation directly on the plant. Thus, the
            discovery of winsse-making was inevitable at some stage in human history. The evidence shows that this
            was at least 8,000 years ago in the Near East. From there, wine-making spread around the ancient
            Mediterranean civilisations, where the liquid was extensively produced, drunk, and traded. To this day,
            the biggest drinkers of wine remain the Mediterranean countries, with France leading the way.</p>
    <p style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; line-height: 26px;">A similar wine classification is based more specifically on the grape species used, giving such well-
        known names as Pinot Noir and Merlot. Chardonnay grapes remain one of the most widely planted,
        producing an array of white wines, rivaling the cabernet sauvignon grape, a key ingredient in the
        world’s most widely recognised, and similarly named, red wines. 
    <br>
        When one grape species is used, or is
        predominant, the wine produced is called varietal, as opposed to mixing the juices of various identified
        grapes, which results in blended wines. </p>
    <p style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; line-height: 26px;"> The latter process is often done when wine-makers, and the
        people who drink their product, want a consistent taste, year after year. Far from being looked down
        upon, it often results in some of the world’s most expensive bottles, such as the Cote Rotie wines in
        France.</p>
    <p style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; line-height: 26px;"> Increasingly, however, market recognition is based on the location of the wine production, resulting in
        labels such as Bordeaux in France, Napa Valley in California, and the Barossa Valley in Australia.
        Traditional wines made in these places carry trademarks, respected by serious wine drinkers. However,
        an example of the blurred lines is the term ‘champagne’. This was once expected to be made from grapes
        grown in the Champagne region of France, with all the expertise and traditions of that area, but, despite
        legal attempts to trademark the term, it has become ‘semi-generic’, allowing it to be used for any wine of
        this type made anywhere in the world.</p>
